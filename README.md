# Candlestick Checker
Use the most popular candle stick patterns to **reinforce** the signals of your trading indicators.
This tiny library focuses on **practicality** and **simplicity**. It groups the patterns into three main sections:

- **Single Candle Pattern**
  - BullishDoji
  - BullishHammer
  - BearishDoji
  - BearishShotingStar
- **Double Candle Pattern**
  - BullishEngolfer
  - BullishPiercing
  - BullishTweezerBottom
  - BearishEngolfer
  - BearishDarkCloudCover
  - BearishTweezerTop
- **Triple Candle Pattern**
  - BullishMorningStar
  - BullishWhiteSoldiers
  - BullishKicker
  - BearishEveningStar
  - BearishThreeBlackCrows
  - BearishKicker

But instead of worrying about each one of them or checking it one by one, this tiny lib evaluates all of them returning only a **bullish** or **bearish** signal.

# Usage Example
I prefer to check for all in one like in the example bellow, but if you prefer, you may check individually.
```java
// CHECK FOR ALL CANDLE STICK PATTERN

// if you are in a downtrend, check for bullish signals
boolean isSingleBullish = CandleStickFactory.single(candles).isBullish();
boolean isDoubleBullish = CandleStickFactory.doubl(candles).isBullish();
boolean isTripleBullish = CandleStickFactory.triple(candles).isBullish();

if(isSingleBullish || isDoubleBullish || isTripleBullish){
  // if you are in a downtrend and your trending signal are indicating
  // a possible turn over to an uptrend, this could be the right moment to 
  // buy a position. It should act as a reinforcement of your indicators
  
  // ... do something here...
}

// if you are in an uptrend, check for bearish signals
boolean isSingleBearish = CandleStickFactory.single(candles).isBearish();
boolean isDoubleBearish = CandleStickFactory.doubl(candles).isBearish();
boolean isTripleBearish = CandleStickFactory.triple(candles).isBearish();

if(isSingleBearish || isDoubleBearish || isTripleBearish){
  // if you are in an uptrend and your trending signal are indicating
  // a possible turn over to a downtrend, this could be the right moment to 
  // sell a position. It should act as a reinforcement of your indicators
  
  // ... do something here...
}
```


```java
// SINGLE CANDLE STICK PATTERN

// if you are in a downtrend, check for bullish signals
CandleStickFactory.single(candles).isBullish();

// if you are in a uptrend, check for bearish signals
CandleStickFactory.single(candles).isBearish();
```
```java
// DOUBLE CANDLE STICK PATTERN

// if you are in a downtrend, check for bullish signals
CandleStickFactory.doubl(candles).isBullish();

// if you are in a uptrend, check for bearish signals
CandleStickFactory.doubl(candles).isBearish();
```
```java
// TRIPLE CANDLE STICK PATTERN

// if you are in a downtrend, check for bullish signals
CandleStickFactory.triple(candles).isBullish();

// if you are in a uptrend, check for bearish signals
CandleStickFactory.triple(candles).isBearish();
```
